# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is about a gaming site. The general idea is to have one place where you have news
about the up coming game titles, tournaments, esports, also where you can create your own
tournaments for your friends, private or public event, and also the site have a Store where
games can be bought.

This Site contains the next files:
  -GameCenterLobi.html
    -LoL_News.html
    -msi_canceled.html
  -GameStore.html
  -tournaments.html
  -sign_in.html
