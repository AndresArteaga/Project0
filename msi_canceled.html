      <h1>Riot Games cancels the Mid-Season Invitational</h1>
      <img src="images\msi_canceled.jpg" alt="MSI" height="300px">
      <p>In March, which seems so long ago, Riot halted the League of
        Legends European Championship spring season and all League
        Championship Series and Academy games, and changed the format
        of its Spring Finals, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Today it announced that the Mid-Season Invitational, the
        second-biggest tourney on the LoL calendar
        (behind only the World Championship) will also be canceled.</p>
      <p>"The Global League of Legends Esports team has been working
          hard over the past few months to react to these changes,
          support our regional leagues as they have successfully
          pivoted to online competition, and try to preserve our next
          big international competition, the Mid-Season Invitational.
          One outcome of this hard work was the decision to delay MSI
          from May to July with the hope that the crisis would be
          waning, travel restrictions would come down, and we could
          deliver an exceptional MSI," Riot's global head of LoL
          esports John Needham wrote.</p>
